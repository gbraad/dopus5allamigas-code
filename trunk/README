Directory Opus 5 (the last commercial release was 5.82) was compiled under
SAS/C 6. Compilation with other compilers is certainly possible, but it is
left to the individual to make any changes necessary. Note that a small amount
of 68000 assembly code is also used; this would need to be converted to C/C++
before compilation on non-68000 platforms could be possible.
