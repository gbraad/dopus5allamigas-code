removed back tries to fix title-bar drawing for os4 which was done in rev710 and cause troubles because of change of src_title[188] on scr_title[512] in CFG_ENV structure, values of which seems to use later as some hardcore shifting, so we can't just change it like this. Code still can be found in rev710 and can be very good reference to make an fix for title bar (which we still need to do), as code should be kind of the same for all other oses. Through there is also another error in that code was found, like making listers resizing or pressing on RMB freezes, so code in rev710 can be used only as reference for proper fix. Also deleted all KPrintF defines from all module_deps.h and some other include files, as they can cause redefination errors when compile os3 versions.

Thanks to Roman for adding the OpenWorkbenchObject(A) patching code.
Following on from this, the patches now check to see if Workbench is available (by searching for its public port), and passing the call onto the original vectors.
